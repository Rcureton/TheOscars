Create Actors List! Independent Practice (20 mins)

In the independent practice sections, throughout the rest of the lesson and the following lab, you'll work with the student next to you to create a working app by adding code to an existing project and using Git/GitHub to collaborate. Use the screenshot below as a guide for what we will be building.

You will need to work your way through creating layouts, an activity, and an adapter

To start:

One student should make a new Android Studio project, then add it to a new github repo on their account.
Add the second student as a contributor to this repository
The second student should clone the new repo, so they have a local copy and can start working. Just clone the repo, do not fork it
To practice using Git/GitHub as a team, you'll each split the work and build it on feature branches:

Student 1 should create a new branch called actor-layouts and complete a layout for the Main Activity, as well as a custom layout to be used in the adapter.

Student 2 should create a new branch called actor-adapter-and-model and create an Actor class as well as an ActorArrayAdapter class as a custom adapter.

Now, each student should git push origin <branch name>.
